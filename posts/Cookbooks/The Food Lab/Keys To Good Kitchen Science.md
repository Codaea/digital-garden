How does changing this one ingredient change the recipe, and how can we tell the difference?
the answer is double-blind experiments


## What Makes Up Double-Blind Experiments?
### Eliminating Bias

- the person tasting the finished dish shouldn't know the difference between the two and who made what one. 
- the more unsure the food tester is about what the difference is the better

### Have a control

- you need to have two of the same samples so that if one turns out different you know there is a different variable affecting it. 
- if they both taste the same, there wasn't any other variables tampering with the kitchen process. 

### Isolate Variables

- there are so many variables in cooking we cant account for all bazillion them, just try to account for some of them. 
- we can just hope the difference between the variables can be negligible. 
- also do your best to ensure all samples are treated the same, like 
	- One Cook
	- Same time Rising
	- Same time in fridge
	- Same time in oven
	- And much more

### Keep your shit Together (Stay Organized)

- have a testing sheet where tasters can rate the foods they eat on scales of 1 - 10

### Watch For Palate Fatigue

- food tastes different after eating so much
- its ideal to have each person start on a different sample
- you should also get something they can drink between tastes

### Taste 

- the tasters cannot share thoughts on the food whatsoever because mood, emotion, and appetite can play a role. 
- you should have your questions also be analytical too for testing sheet. 

### Analyze

- now that you have data, look through it. 
- create trend lines and graphs to prove if your theory is correct.
