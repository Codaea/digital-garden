## Pots And Pans

### Material

two things matter in pans, ability to distribute heat evenly (conductivity) and its ablity to retain heat and transfer it to food efficiently (heat capacity and density) 

- **Stainless Steel** - easy to maintain (dons't rust) but a bad heat conductor. heat will not travel fast through it. can also develop hot and cold spots so food from your burners so uneven cooking [[How To Determine A Pans Hot And Cold Spots]]
- **Aluminum** - better heat conductor, one of the best. not very dense so needs thick pans. discolors and pits if exposed to acidic ingredients: wine, lemon juice, tomatoes, etc.
- **Anodized Aluminum** - like aluminum but treated for acidic foods. ideal for cooking foods that don't need a extraordinary amount of heat
- **Copper** - even better than aluminum, and way denser. will cost your soul though $
- **Laminated** or **Tri-Ply** - offers the best of both worlds. layer of aluminum between stainless steel layers. high density and high conductivity
- **Nonstick Pans** - are good for eggs. make sure its a good one because the coating can come off and that is not something you should be eating
- **Cast Iron** - best at retaining heat, meaning the pan doesn't cool down when you add food to it. and its also oven safe. it heats unevenly so make sure burner is the same size. It also needs a good layer of seasoning in it before food will stop sticking to it. it can also rust, and you can't cook overly acidic foods in it because it will pick up flavor and color. also is heavy and requires special seasoning.
