## Initial Seasoning

when u buy a cast iron, its either bullet grey (unseasoned) or slick black surface (pre seasoned) 

how does seasoning work? 

the surface of a cast iron under a microscope shows tons of tiny cracks and irregularities, causing food to stick. 

Here’s how to build up the initial layer of seasoning in your pan:
-  Scrub the pan by pouring ½ cup kosher salt into it and rubbing it with a paper towel. This will scour out any dust and impurities that have collected in it. Then wash it thoroughly with hot, soapy water and dry thoroughly. If your oven has a self-cleaning cycle, one trip through with the pan left inside will demolish even the toughest cooked-on crud and give you a bare pan to start with.
- Oil your pan by rubbing every surface—including the handle and the bottom—with a paper towel soaked in a highly unsaturated fat like corn, vegetable, or canola oil. Unsaturated fats are more reactive than saturated fats (like shortening, lard, or other animal-based fats), and thus polymerize better. It’s an old myth that bacon fat or lard makes the best seasoning agent, probably borne of the fact that those fats were very cheap back in cast-iron’s heyday.
- Heat your pan in a 450°F oven for 30 minutes (it will smoke), or until its surface is distinctly blacker than when you started. An oven will heat the pan more evenly than a burner will, leading to a better initial layer of seasoning.
- Repeat the oiling and heating steps three to four times, until the pan is nearly pitch-black. Pull it out of the oven and place it on the stovetop to cool. Your pan is now seasoned and ready to go.

to maintain the seasoning

- Use the pan often. A good layer of polymers should build up slowly in a succession of very thin layers. This means using your pan as much as possible—particularly for oil-based cooking such as frying or searing. Avoid making liquid-based dishes in the pan until it has acquired a reasonably good layer of seasoning.
- Clean the pan immediately after use. Removing food debris is much easier with a hot pan than one that has cooled. If you clean your cast-iron skillet while it is still hot, chances are all you’ll need is a tiny bit of soap and a sponge.
- Avoid tough abrasives. These include metal scouring pads and cleaners like Comet or Bar Keepers Friend. The scrubby side of a sponge should be plenty for most tasks. I’m particularly wary about this at dinner parties, when a well-intentioned guest may decide to chip in after the meal and get a little too generous with the elbow grease, scrubbing out some of my seasoning.
- Dry the pan thoroughly and oil it before storing. After rinsing the pan, set it on a burner and heat it until it dries and just starts to smoke, then rub the entire inside surface with a paper towel dipped lightly in oil. Take it off the heat and let it cool to room temperature. The oil will form a protective barrier, preventing it from coming into contact with moisture until its next use.
