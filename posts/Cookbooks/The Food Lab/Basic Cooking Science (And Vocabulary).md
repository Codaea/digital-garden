### General Stuff

- **Heat** is energy that can be transfered from hot systems to cold systems.
- **Temperature** is a system of measurement that allows to gauge heat 
- **Density** amount of molecules in a given space
- **Specific Heat Capacity** the amount of energy it takes to raise a given amount of material to raise to a certain temperature. for Example, “it takes exactly one calorie of energy (yes, calories are energy!) to raise one gram of water by one degree Celsius.”

for example, hot air will cook slower than hot water because the water contains more energy

### Sources Of Energy And Heat Transfer

#### Conduction

- the direct transfer of energy from one solid body to another. 
- any pan ever

#### Convection

- the transfer of one solid body to another through the intermediary of a fluid—that is, a liquid or a gas. 
- This is a moderately efficient method of heat transfer, though in cooking its efficiency depends greatly on the way the fluid flows around the food. 
- The motion of the fluid is referred to as **Convection Patterns**. some examples of Convection are 
	-  Steaming asparagus stalks
	- Boiling dumplings in stock
	- Deep-frying onion rings
	- Barbecuing a pork shoulder
	- The top of a pizza baking in an oven

#### Radiation

- a transfer of energy through space via electromagnetic waves.
- some examples are
	- Roasting a pig next to hot coals
	- getting a tan from the sun
	- broiling salmon


in order for food to cook all the way through, the outer layers must transfer heat to the inner layers until it reaches the center. there are tricks for minimizing the gradient.
