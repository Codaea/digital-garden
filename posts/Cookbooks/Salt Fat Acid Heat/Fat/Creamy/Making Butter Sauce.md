#butterWaterEmulsion

temp is crucial with butter water emulsions. 

1. start with cold butter and a warm pan. 
2. after removing steak, fish filet, or pork from the pan tip out the execess fat. 
3. place the pan over the heat and add just enough liquid (water wine, stock) to coat the bottom. 
4. use a wooden spoon to scrape crusty bits into the sauce and bring it to a boil. 
5. for each serving, add 2 tablespoons of cold butter and swirl
6. let the butter melt in, dont let it get so hot the butter sizzles, as long is there is water, it should be fine. (butter melting point is way below water)
7. once sauce begins to thicken, turn off heat and continue to stir. 
8. taste for salt and if needed add some lemon or wine. 
9. spoon over food and serve immediately. 

same method works for [[Butter-Water Sauces]].
