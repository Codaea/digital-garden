For making mayo choose your oil based on what you intend to put it on. 

**What oil should i use?**
-  for a BLT use [[Fat#Neutral Tasting Oils]] such as grape-seed. 
-  for aioli use olive oil.

for each egg yolk you use use about 3/4 of a cup of oil for it to be stable. 
its best to only make what you are going to so small amounts, don't go cosco mode. 

its best to use room temperature ingredients. so pull the eggs out of the fridge. 

add the egg yolks to the bowl and start whisking, slowly adding the oil in. once youve added about half the oil and created a stable base, add the oil faster. if the mayo thickens, add some lemon drops or water to thin it back out.
