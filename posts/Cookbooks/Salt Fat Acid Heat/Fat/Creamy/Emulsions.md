## What is a Emulsion?

when two liquids that normally don't like to mix together (fat and water) give up and join each other. 
In the kitchen, a emulsion is a temporary peace between fat and water. the result is tiny droplets of one mixed in the other, making a creamy mixture. 

### Familiar emulsions
- Mayo and hollandaise
- Vinaigrette's
- Butter, cream, and milk
- Peanut Butter and tahini
- Chocolate
- crema on top of a expresso

#### Vinaigrette 
oil and water. putting them together they don't mix but sit on top of one another. but shaking or whisking them together breaking them into tiny droplets so it looks like one liquid with a new consistency. 

^^ Thats a emulsion! 

if we leave the Vinaigrette for 5 minutes, the Emulsion will break. this happens because the fat and water molecules begin to reconnect to themselves forming two layers again. **To make Emulsions more stable, use a [[Emulsifier]].** Emulsifiers Act as a bridge between the fat and oil and let both connect to it. 

## Using Emulsions

good for enriching plain foods. 

### Achieving Creaminess: Mayo

[[Making Mayo]]
- mayo is a oil in water emulsion made by whisking oil into a egg yolk. 
- the egg yolk contains [[Lecithin]], a [[Emulsifier]].
- emulsions is always looking for a way to break. 

### Retaining Creaminess: Butter

- Butter isn't pure fat. its fat, water, and milks solids all held together by a emulsion.
- most emulsions are only stable in a few degrees in temperature, butter is stable from 32F to 90F.

### Breaking Emulsions

- some emulsions break with time, others break if fat and water is combined to quickly. 
- the most common way a emulsion breaks is via temperature swing. 
- some emulsions must remain cold and others warm. 

- when you want to break a emulsion, like when making [[Clarified Butter]]
### Fixing Emulsions

the best way to learn to fix emulsions is by breaking one on purpose and then salvaging it. 
Example: [[Fixing Mayo]]

- if a Emulsion starts to go south, stop adding fat.
- if the emulsion isn't thickening, stop adding oil. 
- use splashes of cold and hot water to help regulate temperature
