Shortening in baking refers to a type of solid fat that is commonly used in various baked goods to achieve specific textures and qualities in the final product. It is typically made from hydrogenated vegetable oils, which are processed to become solid at room temperature. Shortening is prized for its ability to create flaky and tender textures in pastries, pie crusts, cookies, and other baked items.

1. **Flakiness**: Shortening has the ability to create layers in baked goods, leading to a flaky and tender texture. This is especially desired in pie crusts and certain types of biscuits.
    
2. **Reduced Gluten Formation**: Shortening interferes with the formation of gluten in dough or batter. This can result in baked goods that are more tender and less chewy.
    
3. **Texture and Moistness**: Shortening can contribute to a soft and moist texture in baked items, keeping them fresh for a longer time.
    
4. **Neutral Flavor**: Shortening has a neutral flavor, which can be advantageous when you don't want the fat to impart a strong taste to your baked goods. This is especially important in recipes where the flavors of other ingredients need to shine.
    
5. **Higher Melting Point**: Unlike butter, which melts at a relatively low temperature, shortening has a higher melting point. This makes it suitable for recipes that require higher baking temperatures, like deep-frying or creating pie crusts.
