## What is Gluten Development?

- gluten is composed of glutenin and gliadin
- when you combine wheat flour and liquid they link up and form long chains. 
- as dough is kneaded or batter is mixed, the chains develop into strong webs or the **Gluten Network**. 
- expanding the webs is called **Gluten Development** and its what makes dough chewy and elastic. 

## Curving Gluten Development

### Why?
- gluten develops, dough becomes chewier. bakers use high protein content flours and knead dough for long periods of time to create crusty chewy country loaves. Salt also preserves the strength of Gluten Networks.
- pastry chefs try to limit how chewiness and elasticity to make flaky and moist textures so they try to control gluten development. 

### What helps?

- using low protein flowers and avoid kneading 
- sugar and acids like buttermilk and yogurt discourage gluten from developing. so adding them early helps will tenderize pastries. 
- too much fat can help stop gluten networks from forming. when coating individual gluten strands, fat prevents them from sticking to one another and lengthening. this is where [[Shortening]] comes from. because the gluten strands remain short instead of lengthening. 


## How to get what your looking for. 

- Four Main Variables Control determine texture of baked goods. 
	 1. fat
	 2. water
	 3. yeast
	 4. how much the dough has been kneaded or worked. 


## Types of dough

### Short Doughs

- Short Dough are epitome of tenderness, crumbling and melting. 
- flour and fat blended together intimately, resulting in smooth dough. 
- most recipes call for soft or melted butter to encourage gluten network from forming.
- soft enough to press into the pan

### Flaky Doughs

- break apart into flakes when you take a bite. 
- like croissants and pie crust. should crumble when cut. 
- fat is also worked into the flour to only let a little gluten development to occur. 

to get flakes, fat must be cold so it remains in distinct pieces. when the cold pieces of butter, entrapped air, and steam from the water relaces push apart layers of dough to create flakes. 

the flakiest pastries are made with [[Laminated Doughs]]. to get that texture, they wrap dough around butter and roll it out and fold several times. each roll and fold is called a **Turn**. when turned 6 times it will have 730 layers. when it gets hot in oven, butter turns into steam creating 730 layers. make sure everything remains cold when working on **laminated doughs**. Yeasted doughs with developed gluten make for great croissants and Danishes. (Be careful, its a very thin line where its good.)
