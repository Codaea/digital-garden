Laminated dough is a type of dough used in pastry making that involves a process called "laminating." This process creates layers of butter or fat within the dough, resulting in a flaky and tender texture when baked. Laminated dough is the foundation for many iconic pastries, including croissants, Danish pastries, puff pastry, and various other flaky baked goods.

The basic process of creating laminated dough involves repeatedly folding and rolling out the dough to create alternating layers of dough and fat. This layering creates the characteristic flakiness as the fat melts during baking, creating steam that lifts and separates the dough layers.

Here's a general overview of the process:

1. **Preparation:** A basic dough is made using flour, water, salt, and sometimes a small amount of yeast. This dough is mixed until it forms a smooth consistency.

2. **Incorporating Fat:** A block of butter or another type of fat is placed on the dough and then folded and rolled out. This process helps to evenly distribute the fat within the dough, creating thin layers of fat between layers of dough.

3. **Folding and Rolling:** The dough is folded over the fat and then rolled out to a thin sheet. It's then folded again, creating more layers. This folding and rolling process is repeated several times, typically around three to six folds, to build up the layers.

4. **Resting and Chilling:** Between each round of folding and rolling, the dough is allowed to rest and chill in the refrigerator. This resting period prevents the butter from melting and ensures the dough maintains its structure.

5. **Final Shaping:** After several rounds of folding and chilling, the dough is rolled out one final time to the desired thickness for the specific pastry being made. It's then cut, shaped, and filled according to the pastry's recipe.

6. **Baking:** The laminated dough is baked in a preheated oven. As the fat layers melt during baking, steam is released, which causes the layers to separate and create the characteristic flaky texture.

Laminated dough can be a bit time-consuming to make due to the repeated folding and chilling steps, but the end result is well worth the effort, producing pastries with a delicate, airy, and buttery interior surrounded by a crispy, golden-brown exterior.
