## Roles Of Fat

if you don't know what role fat is playing ask yourself these questions.

- Will this fat bind various ingredients together? if so its a Main Ingredient
- Does this fat play a textural role? for flaky, creamy and light, its a main ingredient. if its crisp, its a cooking medium. for tender it could be either.
- Will this fat be heated to cook the food? if so, cooking medium
- If its used as a garnish or to adjust flavor, its a Seasoning. 

### Main Ingredient 
- source of flavor and texture
- example - fat ground into a burgur or olive oil in pesto.

### Cooking Medium
- any fat you use to cook food is a medium
- fats can be heated to extreme temps
- allows better food surface coverage ( like deep frying! )

### Seasoning
- add flavor or enrich texture just before serving

## Effects of Fat on Flavor
- fat carries flavor
- fat coats tongue letting aromatic compounds stay for longer
- add [[Aromatics]] directly to cooking fat
- helps with surface [[Browning]] because of high temp limit vs water

## The Flavors Of Fat
### Olive Oil
- staple of Mediterranean cooking foods inspired by Italian, Spanish, Greek, Turkish, North African, and Middle Eastern.
- medium from soups and pastas to roasted veggies and meats

#### Choosing Olive Oil Brand
- shop by taste, not price
- good olive oil is multidimentional
- olive oil is produced seasonally, look for production date to make sure your buying a current pressing, goes rancid 12-14 months after its been pressed.
- look for oils that are 100% californian or italian olives, not made in Italy, packed in Italy, bottled in Italy
##### What Not to buy
- **Bad Olive Oil** is bitter, overwhelmengly spicy, dirty, rancid
- if it smells like a box of crayons, or candlewax or there is oil floating on top like a old jar of peanut butter its rancid.

#### Storing a Olive Oil
- keep away from constant tempature fluxuations like stove and sunlight
- store in cool dark place or in dark glass bottle to keep light out

#### Categories of Olive Oils
- everyday oils, finishing oils, and flavored oils
- everyday oils for general cookery
- finishing oils for where you want olive oil flavor to stand out
- flavored olive oils are usualy low quality to mask bad olive oil
- the exception to flavored olive oil is *argrumato* oil that is where they add citrus fruit while milling

### Butter
 - can be used as cooking medium, main ingredient or seasoning.
 - 3 types, Salted, Unsalted, and Cultured

#### Salted
- salted and tangy cultured butters are best as is, like bread spread

#### Unsalted
- use unsalted butter when cooking so cause you cant predict salted butter
- gently heating unsalted butter until the solids brown you get [[Brown Butter]], that is nutty and sweet
- you can get make [[Clarified Butter]] as a medium for high heat cooking

### Seed and Nut Oils
Plant Based Oils

#### Neutral Tasting Oils
- neutral tasting seed or nut oil is important cause you don't always want the fat to flavor a dish, you just need a cooking medium
- **Peanut oil**, **Expeller-pressed canola oil**, and **Grape-seed Oil** are all good choices cause they **don't taste like anything**
- they also all have high smoke points

#### More Oils
just more oil stuff

##### Coconut Oil
- a solid fat, great for making pastries
- good cooking fat for roasted root vegetables
- also good in granola

##### Specialty Seed and Nut Oils 
- vibrant flavors and good seasonings
- Flaxseed Oil, Chia Seed Oil and way more

### Animal Fats
> "in general, fat makes meat taste good"

- used as main ingredient cooking medium or seasoning depend on its form.

#### Beef
- solid its called suet
- liquid its called tallow
- tallow is often used for frying frenchfires 

#### Pork
- solid its called pork fat
- liquid its called lard
- high smoke point
- Use solid pork fat for **[[Barding and Larding]]** (supplementing lean meats with solid fat to keep them from drying out)
- common countries are mexico, american south, south italy and north Philippines.

#### Chicken Duck and Goose
- only used in liquid form as cooking median.
- Schmaltz ([[Rendering]] Chicken Fat) is a tradition ingredient in the jewish kitchen
- save duck or goose fat that renders when roasting a bird, strain it, and use it to fry potatoes or root vegetables,

#### Lamb
- also called Suet
- not rendered but important ingredient in lamb sausages such as *merguez* in countries where pork is not consumed.

## Heating Median Fats Properly
- Preheat the pan to reduce the amount of time fat spends in direct contact with hot metal, minimizing opportunity to deteriorate.
- as oil is heated, it breaks down, leading to flavor degradation
- food is more likely to stick to a cold pan
- **EXCEPTIONS EXIST!!** Both will burn if the pan is too hot, so you so you must heat them up gently.
- the pan should be hot enough so oil immediately ripples and shimmers when added. Test the pan with a drop of water. if it crackles a little bit before evaporating, the pan is ready.

## How Fat Works
> "As with salt, I encourage you to abandon any gear of fat, for knowing how to use fat properly may lead you yo use less of it. the best way to use fat is to pay attention to certain sensory cues. some ingredients, such as eggplant and mushrooms act like sponges, quickly absorbing fat then cooking dry against the hot metal. using too little fat in a pan... will result in dark bitter blisters on the surface of the food. other ingredients will release their own fat as they cook. Let your eyes ears and taste bugs guide you in how much fat to use."



- *which* fats we use primarily affect flavor, but *how* we use them will determine texture, which is just as important in good cooking
- depending on how we use fats, we can achieve any one of five distinct textures in our food

**Textures**
- [[Crisp]]
- [[Creamy]] from [[Emulsions]]
- [[Flaky and Tender]]
- [[Light]]

### Layering Fat

- Most dishes benefit from more than 1 type of fat. 
- think about if the fat your adding will make the other ingredients in the dish taste better
- Sometimes fat will be used to achieve multiple textures within 1 dish

### Balancing Fat

the only way to fix a off balanced dish is the same way as salt, refer to [[Salt#Balancing Salt (For when u Fuck up)]]
