**The Goal of all cooking is to achieve your desired result on the outside and the inside of a ingredient at the same time.** 
**The Goal For this it to have a crisp surface and a tender center. **

- for food to become crisp, the water trapped in its cells must evaporate. Water evaporates as it boils, so surface temperature of the ingredient must climb beyond 212F boiling temp.
- to achieve this effect on the entire surface of the food, it needs to be in direct even contact with a heat source, such as a pan at temperatures well beyond 212F.
- no food is perfectly smooth, and nither are pans. in order to get even contact between the two we need a medium fat
- cooking fats can be heated to 350F and beyond before begining to smoke, so they are ideal mediums
- cooking methods where fat is heated to achieve crispness include searing, saut√©ing, pan-,shallow-, and deep-frying.
- using enough fat to create even surface contact will prevent food from sticking to the pan

## Achieving Crispness
- crispness results from foods contact with hot fat and water evaporating from the surface of food. 
- do everything in your power to keep the pan and the fat hot when seeking a golden crust. 
- preheat the pan, then preheat the fat. 
- avoid putting more than a single layer of food into the pan to avoid temp drops
- add food that takes time took cook through (like chicken thigh) to hot fat allowing crust to form then reduce heat to prevent burning and allow thorough cooking.  [[Heat]] #fixLink talks more about this.

## After Crispness

- do not cover or pile up hot crisp foods. they get soggy :(
- allow hot crisp foods to cool off in a single layer.
