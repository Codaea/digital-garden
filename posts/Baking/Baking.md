## Types of bread
there are two types of bread, those that use natural yeast for rising the dough, and those that use chemical compounds like baking soda and baking powder. 

## Baking Percentages

Many recipes rely on _formulas_. This is especially true for bread. These formulas are referred to as baker’s percentages. Each ingredient is expressed as the amount of an ingredient compared to the total amount of flour. Flour is always used as the basis for baker’s percentages because it is usually the most predominant ingredient.

The total amount of flour is considered 100% so all combined ingredients add up to more than 100%. This can get confusing for some since baker’s percentages are different than percentages taught in math. Think of it like this, baker’s percentages are like ratios. Each ingredient is a ratio to the amount of flour which is always 100%. 

**Let’s look at the chart below:**

|**Ingredient**|**Weight**|**Baker’s Percentage**|
|---|---|---|
|Flour|500g|100%|
|Water|300g|60%|
|Yeast|10g|2%|
|Salt|5g|1%|
|**Total**|**815g**|**163%**|

The flour is 100%. Then each ingredient is expressed relative to the flour. Personally, I only use baker’s percentage with developing yeast bread with a certain hydration point. My [homemade ciabatta](https://www.bakedbyanintrovert.com/ciabatta-bread/) is a perfect example of this. 

You can use baker’s percentages for things like a baked custard. For this, each ingredient would be expressed relative to the dairy ingredients (milk and cream) because those make up the bulk of the recipe.
