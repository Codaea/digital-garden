## How to Ship Bread

best type of bread to ship is [[Quick Bread]]. Quick-Bread has a longer shelf life than yeast risen dough. next best choice is bread leavened with sourdough. yeast has the shortest shelf life for shipping. 

Bake your bread on the same day you ship it. Make sure the loaf is completely cool before packaging it. Then, follow these steps:

### Steps to Ship Bread

1. **Wrap the bread.** According to USPS, there are unique methods for wrapping different types of bread. You should double-wrap soft bread in plastic wrap before wrapping it in either a plastic bag or foil. Wrap your stiff, yeast-leavened bread in foil before wrapping it in plastic or adding it to a bread bag. You should wrap crusty bread in plastic wrap or put it in a plastic bag to preserve its moisture before shipping it. While the crust will inevitably soften, this is still preferable to stale bread.
2. **Package your bread in a sturdy box.** A padded envelope will not provide enough protection for your bread. Choose a box that can house your bread without smashing it.
3. **Fill empty spaces in the box with packing supplies.** Bubble packaging is an excellent choice for cushioning shipped bread.
4. **Seal the box with carton sealing tape.** Make sure there aren’t any openings. An airtight box will help keep the bread fresh.

### Consider Par Baking Your Bread for Shipping

Par baking stands for “partially baking”. To par-bake bread, bake the dough 80% of the way and then freeze the loaf. Quick freezing [**with a blast chiller**](https://www.webstaurantstore.com/13657/commercial-blast-chillers.html) kills the yeast’s future power and creates a stable inside without browning the crust. The customer can finish the bread by baking it for an additional 10-15 minutes when it arrives. This allows the customer to enjoy a truly fresh, perfectly browned, and warm loaf of bread.
