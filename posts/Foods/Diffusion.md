the process by which particles or molecules spread out from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration. It's a fundamental concept in physics and chemistry that describes how substances move and mix in gases, liquids, and even solids. Diffusion occurs due to the random motion of particles, and over time, it leads to the equalization of concentration throughout a medium.
