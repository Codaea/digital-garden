- for food to become crisp, the water trapped in its cells must evaporate. Water evaporates as it boils, so surface temperature of the ingredient must climb beyond 212F boiling temp.
- to achieve this effect on the entire surface of the food, it needs to be in direct even contact with a heat source, such as a pan at temperatures well beyond 212F.
- no food is perfectly smooth, and nither are pans. in order to get even contact between the two we need a medium fat
- cooking fats can be heated to 350F and beyond before begining to smoke, so they are ideal mediums
- cooking methods where fat is heated to achieve crispness include searing, saut√©ing, pan-,shallow-, and deep-frying.
- using enough fat to create even surface contact will prevent food from sticking to the pan

## Heating Oils Properly
- Preheat the pan to reduce the amount of time fat spends in direct contact with hot metal, minimizing opportunity to deteriorate.
- as oil is heated, it breaks down, leading to flavor degradation
- food is more likely to stick to a cold pan
- **EXCEPTIONS EXIST!!** Both will burn if the pan is too hot, so you so you must heat them up gently.
- the pan should be hot enough so oil immediately ripples and shimmers when added. Test the pan with a drop of water. if it crackles a little bit before evaporating, the pan is ready.

## Rendering
[[Rendering]]

Fat in meat will prevent it from crisping. even when the aim is not to render fat to use as a cooking medium, this technique is crucial for transforming texture. Crisp bacon is the result of properly rendered fat. fry to hot, it will burn outside and remain flabby. **The Key is to cook slowly enough to allow the fat to render at the same rate the bacon browns**.
