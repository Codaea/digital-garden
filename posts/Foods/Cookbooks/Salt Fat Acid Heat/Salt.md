you don’t always need a little salt, you might need a lot. “He marched me back to the pot and added not one but three enormous palmfuls of kosher salt

- Salt is really important
- Don’t use more salt, use salt better. 
- Your salt should taste like the summer sea, clean taste
- Salt affects taste and flavor
- Affects perception to bitterness to make it less bitter
- Salt masks bitter Tastes far better than sugar
- **Stir Taste Adjust**


## Salt types

### table salt
- Cube shape
- Small and dense
- Unless noted has iodine
- Iodine salt makes things **taste metallic**
- Has other things in it that aren’t salt related for chemical balancing

**Get something else if its all you have**

### Kosher Salt
Two major producers, Diamond Chrystal and Morton’s. They do it different ways so it tastes different 
**THE BRANDS ARE NOT INTERCHANGEABLE!!**

>"Where DC (Diamond Chrystal ) readily adheres to food and crumbles easily, Morton’s is denser, and Almost twice as salty by volume” 

- Diamond crystal is better for cook quickly food dissolve 2x fast
- The more quickly salt dissolved the less likely to  over season a dish cause you might think it needs more salt when salt needs more time to dissolve 
- Diamond crystal sticks to food better

### Sea Salt

##### Natural sea salts
- Great texture
- don’t waste on dissolving, put it on top so you taste it later
- Maldon and *fleur de sel* salt for last second garnishing

##### Refined granular sea salt
Use to season foods from within
Ideal for everyday cooking 

## Seasoning

Anything that heightens flavor is seasoning, but is generally salt. 

- Taste and adjust 
- Season slice tomato’s??

“Salt to taste”


## Science For Salt

"Some ingredients and cooking methods required giving salt enough time to penetrate food and distribute itself within it. Sometimes, key is creating a salty enough environment to allow food to absorb the right amount while it cooks"

- Osmosis - movement from the saltier side to the less salty side across cell walls (faster than diffusion) (really just movement in general is called osmosis)
- Diffusion - movement to from saltier side to less salty side until it’s evenly distributed throughout ( moment where its balancing) [[Diffusion]] ^f23e0b

Given the chance salt will always try to become evenly distributed. 

## Salting Food

### Salting Meatz 

#### Pre Salting
- aim to season one day in advance
- Seasoning in advance gives salt plenty of time to diffuse evenly throughout the meat. 
- the larger and denser the meat the earlier you should salt it.
- the colder it is, the longer it takes for salt to work
- you can salt to early, it will just dehydrate meat. wrap and freeze for later.
- 

#### Sciency Stuff

Salt dissolved protein strands into gel with time, letting absorb water better while cooking. Water is moisture: it’s presence makes meat tender and juicy.

Think of Protein strands as a lose coil with water molecules bound to outside of surface. Unseasoned protein when heated the strands denatures, squeezing water out of protein. Leaving meat dry and overcooked.**Using salt it disrupts proton structure so water remains bound**. Meat remained moist, so **greater cooking margin of error too **.

### Salting Seafood

- dont salt earlier than 15 minutes and thicker and meatier fish like tuna and swordfish can be salted 30 minutes ahead.
- season all seafood at time of cooking to preserve texture

### Salting Fat

- salt will not dissolve in pure fat
- most fats have a little water.
- season fats early and wait for salt to dissolve before tasting and adding more if needed.
- dissolve in water then add to fat for even immediate distribution (you can also use lemon juice or vinegar.)
- leaner the meat the higher the water content. high water content = higher salt capacity

### Salting Eggs

- absorbs salty easily
- more salt = less cooking time
- add a pinch before eggs to be scrambled, omelettes, custards or frittatas before cooking
- lightly season water for poaching eggs
- season all just before serving

> "The More quickly the proteins set, the less of a chance they will have to expel water they contain. The more water the eggs retain as they cook the more moist and tender the final texture will be "

### Salting Vegetables, Fruits and Fungi

- Most Vegetable and fruit cells contain a undigestible carbohydrate called **pectin**
- pectin softens throughout ripening or applying heat, making it more tender and delicios.
- salt assists in weakening pectin.
- when in doubt salt vegetables before you cook them. 
- 15 minutes before is when to salt

- shrooms dont have pectin, dont pre salt to keep texture, wait till brown in pan

### Salting Legumes and Grains
Legumes - member of the pea family

- salt does not toughen dried beans, it helps break weaken pectins
- add salt when you soak them or begin to cook them, whatever comes first.
- tough beans require simmering longer

### Salting Dough and Batters

- salt helps strengthen glueten making it tougher
- add to bread and dough early
- add salt earlier to ramen and udon
- add later to pasteiers like pancakes and cake to keep them tender

## Cooking Foods In Salted Water

- properly seasoned cooking water encourages food to retain its nutrients.

### How it works
- When cooking green beans in water, diffusion comes into play due to differences in mineral concentration.
- Unseasoned water typically has a lower mineral content than the green beans themselves.
- As a result of diffusion, minerals from the green beans move into the water, leading to less bland and gray green beans.
- Conversely, if you cook the green beans in mineral-rich water, they will absorb salt from the water to reach equilibrium.
- Diffusion causes the flavors and minerals to distribute more evenly, enhancing the taste and quality of the cooked green beans.

### Effect
- will look greener and cook quicker.

### Amount of salt to use
- season until it tastes like seawater (but not actual sea water just what your memory is!)
- the goal is to create a salty enough environment to allow the salt to diffuse into the ingredient while its in the pot of water.
- make sure to give enough time for salt to dissolve in water. 
- don't let the pot sit boiling for too long cause salinity will go up and it will be too salty.
- make sure to taste your water

salt pasta water, potato cooking water, and pots of grains and legumes as early as possible to allow salt ot dissolve and diffuse evenly.

if you season correctly you will not have to add more salt before serving for veggies.

## Using Salt

> "don't use spoons to salt, its lame" - Coda

### Measuring salt
abandon precise measurements when cooking. 

most things you should salt to taste unless its precisely weighed out. 

1% salt by weight for meats, vegetables and grains. 
2% salt salinity for blanching vegetables and pasta

**Note:** All salts weigh diffrent amounts, so make sure ur measurements are right.

## Layering Salt
[[Layering]] salt is the act  of working multiple forms of salt into one dish. when layering salt. 

when layering salt, think about a dish a whole and consider all the forms of salt in the dish. neglecting all the forms will result in over-salting more often then not. 

when you realize a dish needs more salt, take a moment to think about where that salt should come from.

## Balancing Salt (For when u Fuck up)
 - **Dilute:** add more unseasoned ingredients. bland, starchy and rich ingredients work the best. 
 - **Halve:** divide the over-salted amount and correct only half of it, fridge and fix the other half later. 
 - **Balance:** sometimes food isn't over-salted. it just needs some acid or fat. 
- **Select:** foods cooked in liquid can often be salvaged if the salty cooking liquid is discarded. 
- **Transform:** make something that was a main ingredient and just make it a background ingredient in a diffrent dish. 
- **Give up and admit defeat:** You can try again next time, Just Stir, Taste Adjust.
