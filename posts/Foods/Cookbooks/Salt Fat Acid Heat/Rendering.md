Inter-muscular and subcutaneous fats - the lumpy bits between the muscles and the layer of fat beneath the skin can be cut into small pieces, placed in a pin with minimal amount of water, and **rendered** or cooked over gentle heat until all the water evaporated. this process transforms solid fat into a liquid that can be used as a medium. the next time you roast a duck, trim all of its excess fat before cooking and render it. Stain it into a glass jar and store in the fridge. it will keep for up to 6 months.

Fat in meat will prevent it from crisping. even when the aim is not to render fat to use as a cooking medium, this technique is crucial for transforming texture. Crisp bacon is the result of properly rendered fat. fry to hot, it will burn outside and remain flabby. **The Key is to cook slowly enough to allow the fat to render at the same rate the bacon browns**.
