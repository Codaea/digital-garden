### FOR THE BATTER

- Unsalted butter, for greasing
- 1½ cups/190 grams all-purpose flour
- 1 cup/200 grams granulated sugar
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon kosher salt
- ½ cup/120 milliliters vegetable oil
- 2 large eggs
- ¼ cup/60 milliliters honey
- 1 cup mashed ripe bananas (from 2 to 3 medium bananas)
- ¼ cup/60 milliliters warm water

### FOR THE TOPPING

- ¼ cup/55 grams brown sugar, preferably light brown or Demerara sugar
- 2 tablespoons granulated sugar
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

**REPARATION**

1. **Step 1**
    
    - Heat oven to 350 degrees.
    - Butter a 9-by-5-inch loaf pan and line it with parchment or wax paper, leaving enough paper hanging over the sides to lift the cake out after baking. (This will prevent the topping from breaking when removing the bread from the pan.)
2. **Step 2**
    
    - Prepare the batter: In a medium bowl, combine flour, granulated sugar, cinnamon, baking soda, and salt.
    - In a large bowl, using a sturdy whisk, beat together oil, eggs, and honey until smooth.
    - Stir in bananas and warm water.
    - Add dry ingredients to the egg-oil mixture and stir to blend.
    - Pour batter into the prepared pan.
3. **Step 3**
    
    - Make the topping: In a small bowl, mix brown sugar, granulated sugar, and cinnamon, using your fingers to break up any lumps.
    - Sprinkle evenly over the batter.
4. **Step 4**
    
    - Bake until a tester inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour, checking after 50 minutes.
    - If the topping shows signs of burning, reduce heat to 325 degrees.
5. **Step 5**
    
    - Remove to a rack and let cool in the pan for 30 minutes.
    - Use the edges of the paper to lift the cake up and out.
    - Place on a rack (leave the paper on) and let cool before slicing and serving
