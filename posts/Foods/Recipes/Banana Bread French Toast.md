I used [[Cinnamon Crunch Banana Bread]] on my first try and made some [[Banana Foster]] to go with it because i figured it would taste really good (it did). The French Toast Batter Was

1 Egg
1 tsp Vanila extract
1/2 tsp cinnamon
1/4 cup milk

mix that all together and dip the Banana Bread in it and then put in pan on medium low heat, i wanna say around 212F ish
#### **Notes:**
DO NOT LEAVE THE BREAD IN THE BATTER. it seemed like the bread absorbed to much of it and then got really heavy and broke apart. so quick dipping
